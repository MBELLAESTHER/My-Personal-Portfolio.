        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>What excites me most about technology is its incredible potential to drive meaningful change in our world.
             I’m passionate about innovative software development, where I can create solutions that address real-life 
             challenges and enhance user experiences. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence fascinates me, as 
             it opens up new avenues for automation and data analysis. I’m particularly motivated by the idea of using 
             tech to empower underserved communities and tackle global issues like inequality. This journey fuels my 
             desire to continuously
             learn and adapt, ensuring I’m always at the forefront of emerging trends and tools in the field.  <br></p>
             <br>
        <p>I’m absolutely thrilled by the endless possibilities that technology offers! My journey in tech 
            has been a wild ride, where I get to craft apps that solve real-world problems and explore the 
            fascinating world of AI. The way technology can drive transformation and create positive change 
            in underserved communities truly motivates me. <br>
            <br>
            When I’m not coding or diving into the latest trends, you can find me experimenting in the 
            kitchen, trying to bake the perfect chocolate cake (it’s a work in progress!) or biking through
             the city, pretending I’m in a high-speed chase. My passion for learning keeps me on my toes, 
             always eager to discover something new, whether it’s a fresh tech trend or a quirky fact about 
             psychology. I believe in mixing fun with tech, because who says you can’t enjoy the journey?
